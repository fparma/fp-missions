to use this: extract it in your missions folder, e,g : C:\Users\cuel\Documents\ArmA 2\missions
make a new mission on the island you want, press "Merge" and select this template.
then copy-paste all of the stuff except "mission.sqm" from the template folder that you extracted.

Check the init.sqf, most stuff is commented.
To disable ambient civilians/vehicles remove the correct module from the editor.

shk_taskmaster is a great script to create tasks, spend some time reading the intro.
